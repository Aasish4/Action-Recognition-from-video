In deep learning, you must have used CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) for a number of learning tasks. These may include image recognition, classification, object localization and detection, and many more. But in this tutorial, we will learn how to classify (recognize) actions in videos. In short, we will give video input to a trained model, and the model will tell us what is the action that is taking place in the video.
